### Gist Integration
====

Setup

Create a file named `rawFile.conf` and put in it the following line:

```bash
rawLink="https://gist.github.com/.../download"
```

The full path will be the raw view of your gist with your private aliases.

I recommend you create a private gist called .gistaliases and name the file .gistaliases
